# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval status using machine learning techniques. Given various factors such as applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, etc., the model predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle. It contains information about loan applicants, including their income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, etc. You can download it from my repositry also.

## Machine Learning Model
We used a [Random Forest Classifier] [Naive-Bayes Classifier] [Desicion Tree Classifier] [K-Neighbors Classifier] from scikit-learn to build the prediction model. The model was trained on 70% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 30%.


## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `loan_approval_prediction.ipynb` to train and test the model.
2. Use the trained model to predict loan approval status for new applicants.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in predicting loan approval status.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
